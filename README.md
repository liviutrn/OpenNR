# OpenNR 2.20.0

OpenNR is a VR neural-rendering development project combining the native Open Shaders integration, synchronized capture, and separate model research. **2.20.0 adds NR-only center coverage (full DLSS eye, 100% NR model resolution on the NR region) and eye-staggered temporal reuse, fixes motion-vector scaling in the pre-upscale, temporal-reuse and result-stabilizer paths, removes the Performance Overlay, and locks NR to full resolution.** Saved user settings are normalized on load (reduced NR tiers, adaptive NR and pre-upscale NR become off); the package does not rewrite them.

The canonical source is this repository. Large data and environments live outside D:. The runtime retains the `CommunityShaders.dll` filename and asset paths for compatibility.

## Build and package

From PowerShell at the repository root:

```powershell
.\tools\Build-OpenNR.ps1
.\tools\Build-OpenNR.ps1 -Targets @('CommunityShaders','cpp_tests','Package-AIO-Manual')
& 'E:\OpenNR_Builds\2.20.0\tests\cpp\Release\cpp_tests.exe'
```

The standard local archive is `E:\OpenNR_Builds\2.20.0\dist\OpenNR 2.20.0.7z`.
The build disables automatic deployment. It requires the declared external dependencies and local/private runtime inputs described in setup. This repository does not distribute NVIDIA's private carrier or recovered weights.

## Storage

`config/paths.example.json` documents the external roots. Optional machine overrides belong in ignored `config/paths.local.json`. Python path precedence is explicit CLI argument, `OPENNR_<KIND>_ROOT`, machine configuration, then default. `python tools/opennr_paths.py output` prints the resolved location.

Maintained training/cache/export writers reject destinations physically on D:, including junctions and drive aliases. Native capture and benchmark writers also resolve physical storage before recording. New capture configurations default to `C:/OpenNR/Captures`; existing saved paths remain selected and are validated before capture starts. Legacy experiment scripts are historical tools and require explicit external output paths.

## Acceptance status

2.20.0 source, build, unit-test and package evidence is recorded in the linked release note. In-headset frame time and visual acceptance of NR Coverage and eye-staggered reuse are not yet measured; compare NR Coverage 100% against 85% and 80% in the same scene. The 2.18.0 local VR acceptance (better performance, no visible problems) remains the last headset result for the native Feature 18 line.

No learned model, recovered teacher, or generated target set is promoted. Native Feature 18 resources and capture provenance remain authoritative. No remote release is published.

## Attribution

The runtime inherits Open Shaders and Community Shaders; see its [license](runtime/open-shaders/COPYING) and [branding and attributions](runtime/open-shaders/BRANDING_AND_ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Third-party source and private local artifacts retain their own ownership and terms. See [dependency boundaries](third_party/README.md).
