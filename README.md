# OpenNR 2.18.0

OpenNR is a VR neural-rendering development project combining the native Open Shaders integration, synchronized capture, and separate model research. **2.18.0 promotes the locally tested 2.17.0 VR performance candidate and fixes a Skyrim VR address-library startup failure.** Adaptive NR and adaptive Crop retain their existing opt-in defaults. Saved user settings are not rewritten by the package.

The canonical source is this repository. Large data and environments live outside D:. The runtime retains the `CommunityShaders.dll` filename and asset paths for compatibility.

- [Historical research status](docs/RESEARCH_STATUS_PRE_CONSOLIDATION.md): prior experiments and model-quality evidence.
- [Experiment index](experiments/README.md): archived and reproducible research.

## Build and package

From PowerShell at the repository root:

```powershell
.\tools\Build-OpenNR.ps1
.\tools\Build-OpenNR.ps1 -Targets @('CommunityShaders','cpp_tests','Package-AIO-Manual')
& 'E:\OpenNR_Builds\2.18.0\tests\cpp\Release\cpp_tests.exe'
```

The standard local archive is `E:\OpenNR_Builds\2.18.0\dist\OpenNR 2.18.0.7z`.
The build disables automatic deployment. It requires the declared external dependencies and local/private runtime inputs described in setup. This repository does not distribute NVIDIA's private carrier or recovered weights.

## Storage

`config/paths.example.json` documents the external roots. Optional machine overrides belong in ignored `config/paths.local.json`. Python path precedence is explicit CLI argument, `OPENNR_<KIND>_ROOT`, machine configuration, then default. `python tools/opennr_paths.py output` prints the resolved location.

Maintained training/cache/export writers reject destinations physically on D:, including junctions and drive aliases. Native capture and benchmark writers also resolve physical storage before recording. New capture configurations default to `C:/OpenNR/Captures`; existing saved paths remain selected and are validated before capture starts. Legacy experiment scripts are historical tools and require explicit external output paths.

## Acceptance status

2.18.0 source/build/package and local VR test evidence is recorded in the linked release note. The adaptive resource-envelope fallback is retained: rejection holds further crop tier changes until restart; NR can continue adapting. The user reported better performance and no visible problems in the 2.17.0 test. Controlled frame-time gains, stereo transitions, and sustained HMD behavior remain separate checks.

No learned model, recovered teacher, or generated target set is promoted. Native Feature 18 resources and capture provenance remain authoritative. No remote release is published.

## Attribution

The runtime inherits Open Shaders and Community Shaders; see its [license](runtime/open-shaders/COPYING) and [branding and attributions](runtime/open-shaders/BRANDING_AND_ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Third-party source and private local artifacts retain their own ownership and terms. See [dependency boundaries](third_party/README.md).
