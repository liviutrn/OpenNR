# stb_image_write_hdr_png

16-bit HDR PNG writer (cICP/sBIT/cHRM/iCCP), stb-style single header. Extends
`stb_image_write.h` (provided by vcpkg `stb`) — define `STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION`
in exactly one TU that includes `stb_image_write.h` then this header.

## Vendoring policy

`stb_image_write_hdr_png.h` is vendored **verbatim** (byte-identical to upstream). Do
**not** edit it — all integration lives in our own glue (`src/...` impl TU + the
ScreenshotFeature encode path). Keeping it pristine means absorbing an upstream
improvement is a clean drop-in (no patch to re-apply).

If a local change ever proves unavoidable, keep it as a separate `.patch` re-applied by
the update script (`git apply --3way`), never inline edits — but prefer doing the work in
our glue instead.

## Known upstream issues (intentionally not patched)

- `stbi_write_hdr_png_to_func` leaks `data_compressed` if the final
  `STBIW_MALLOC(file_size)` fails. Triggers only on OOM while allocating the whole
  output PNG (capture fails harmlessly in that case), so we keep the header pristine
  rather than carry a patch. Fix belongs upstream in ReShade.

## Updating
